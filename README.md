## Python-Programming-Random-Password-Generator

## Defining Your Problem:

I recently had my password stolen online from a online gaming account. It turns out that the password that I picked for that account was not very strong, nor was it able to protect my account from getting hacked. I then came to the realization that I needed to find a way to come up with stronger passwords when it comes to the applications that I use

So, I decided to design a random password generator using the coding langauge Python. I chose to use the the programing application Visual Code Studio when writing the random password generator 

## Advantages of Python Coding:

* Very simple and easy to use
* Password length can be up to 999 characters in length
* Characters used are letters of the alphabet (both upper and lower case), numbers (0-9), and special characters
* Every password generatored is unique and strong

## Working Through Specific Examples of how to use the Python Program:

Scenario 1: The user picks 1 after they determine the password length, meaning they only want the password to generate letters from the alphabet:
 
1. The user wants a 5-character long password, that only has alphabet characters in it. (Picks 1 from choices.) 
2. The password is generated to their specified length: (ex: aUsQo)
3. The user likes the generated password, or they can regenerate another

Scenario 2: The user picks 2 after they determine the password length, meaning they only want the password to generate numbers:

1. The user wants a 5-character long password, that only has number characters in it. (Picks 2 from choice.)
2. The password is generated to their specified length: (ex: 61901)
3. The user likes the generated password, or they can regenerate another

Scenario 3: The user picks 3 after they determine the password length, meaning they only want the password to special characters:

1. The user wants a 5-character long password, that only special characters in it. (Picks 3 from choices.) 
2. The password is generated to their specified length: (ex: $@*!^)
3. The user likes the generated password, or they can regenerate another

Scenario 4: The user picks to 1,2, and 3 after they determine the password length, meaning they want the password to have letters, numbers, and special characters:

1. The player wants a 5-character long password, that only special characters in it. (Picks 1 enter: 2 enter: 3 enter.) 
2. The password is generated to their specified length: (ex: A7$b!)
3. The user likes the generated password, or they can regenerate another
